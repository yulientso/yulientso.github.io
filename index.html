					    --------------------------------------------<br />April 12, 2016<br />It has been half a year since I returned to Los Angeles. I've been busy working at MPC. The best part of being in LA is the unbeatably good weather!<br /><br />--------------------------------------------<br />October 10, 2015<br />Just finished my contract with MPC. What an intensive six-month! Had a lot of fun working and experiencing the Indian culture. Time for a break before I head for Los Angeles.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------<br />August 4, 2015<br />Another year went by since I last updated the site. Lots have happened. I've since left London at the end of 2014, traveled and visited families and friends in different locations, and came to Bangalore, India for a job at MPC. You really never know where life takes you. I'm enjoying the adventure!<br /><br />--------------------------------------------<br />July 27, 2014<br />I have neglected my web site for a while. Life is busy. There have been snowy winters and hot summers in London. For now, I'm teaching compositing at Escape Studios and enjoying the sun. <br /><br />--------------------------------------------<br />May 25, 2012<br />I had the pleasure to do a Nuke course again for the training center of Institute for Information Industry in Taiwan this month. The schedule was tight and pace fast, however the students were most admirable in their efforts and attitude. Bravo! <br /><br />--------------------------------------------<br />March 10, 2012<br />Media Asylum has spun out of Media Village in Singapore as a result of the increased effort to expand their training programs and the goals beyond. Congratulations!  The Nuke training course will be restructured to fit the new agenda.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------<br />September 21, 2011<br />It has been a busy month so far doing Nuke training for the students at SAE Oxford and another group of instructors of Nanyang Polytechnic in Singapore. <br /><br />--------------------------------------------<br />August 29, 2011<br />At BIRTV in Beijing this year Oxygen Tech set up a demo schedule for Foundry prducts, which  regularly attracted a significant crowd. <br /><br />--------------------------------------------<br />July 27, 2011<br />In the last couple of days I did a 2-day Nuke 6.3 New Features training at Escape Studios in London for their advanced Nuke students. Amongest a 3D particle system and planar tracker and others, 6.3 introduced an exciting new compositing mothodology &ndash; deep compositing.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------<br />June 16, 2011<br />Another Nuke class concluded in Singapore last week for some instructors from Nanyang Polytechnic at the training facility of Media Village. The participants left with great proficiency and enthusiasm. NYP will have Nuke as part of the circulum in the upcoming semester. <br /><br />--------------------------------------------<br />May 25, 2011<br />My work on Life of Pi concluded in mid May and has returned to London once again. I'm honored to be a part of it and humbled by all the talented people I met. The friendship and experience I gained make it the most memorable job I've ever had. <br /><br />--------------------------------------------<br />March 3, 2011<br />After some more Nuke training and related events in Japan, Singapore, and Taiwan, I've been involved in Ang Lee's new production of "Life of Pi". It's amazing to see a production in progress. I'll be working in the VFX Department till May/June.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------<br />July 12, 2010<br />Nuke+Ocula seminars based on the presentation of the January Stereo Masterclass in London took place in Seoul, Korea on Apr. 27; Beijing, China on Apr. 29; and at Singapore's CG Overdrive on June 19. The events were a smash, reflecting the interests and needs for stereo  solutions.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------<br />Apr 9, 2010<br />Following the success of Avatar, lots of people are looking into Nuke and Ocula as part of their stereo production tools. Stereo workflow is also the most requested topic during my Nuke demo and training sessions.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------<br />Feb 14, 2010<br />Private training available for NukeX. The basic 3-day training covers all general and NukeX-specific features. Please <a href="(null)/(null)" rel="self" title="Contact Me">contact Janice</a> for detail. <br /><br />--------------------------------------------<br />Dec 12, 2009<br />The first Nuke User Group Meeting took place on Dec. 16, 2009 in Yokohama, Japan, where SIGGRAPH Asia 2009 was held. It was a great success!<br /><br />--------------------------------------------<br />July 01, 2009<br />Authorized Nuke training courses are available in July 2009!<br />

She worked in the digital compositing field for film and television in Los Angeles for many years. She has worked in facilities such as Rhythm & Hues, DRez, and Digiscope, with systems from Quantel Domino to Avid Illusion and Shake and has experience handling client-attended sessions with film directors and producers. Her movie credits can be viewed on <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0875106/" rel="external">IMDB website</a>. <br /><br />While working as a compositor in Hollywood and Los Angeles, Janice taught an After Effects class for film students at the University of Southern California and conducted Domino training on-site in Hong Kong and Hollywood. <br /><br />After a hiatus from compositing to pursue a master degree in Traditional Chinese Medicine for personal fulfillment, she contributed to the re-design of the user interface for Nuke 5 when The Foundry took over its development from Digital Domain in 2007. While she lived in Hong Kong afterwards she spent her time doing occasional Nuke demos for The Foundry in Asian countries and conducting authorized (by a then Foundry authorized Nuke training center in Hong Kong) and private Nuke training courses. <br /><br />She moved back to London in October 2010 but soon afterwards got an opportunity to work on Ang Lee&rsquo;s new production - Life of Pi, in Taiwan. During which time she worked in the Visual Effects Department assisting their Stereo Consultant in visualizing stereo effects theories for special effects and test-comp some live problematic shots.<br /><br />After Life of Pi Janice returned to London and continued to work as a compositor, bouncing back and forth between Framestore&rsquo;s Commercial Department and Cinesite, working on various film and commercial projects, which included stereo conversion of John Carter and World War Z, 4K Sony Bravia commercial, Skyfall title sequence, and 3D compositing for Hummingbird. <br /><br />Timing was right when an opportunity came in late 2013 to work at Escape Studios in the capacity of compositing tutor and courseware developer. She taught in-class as well as on-line courses; updated and consolidated compositing courseware, paving the road for future degreed programs; represented Escape Studios in mentoring and evaluating students&rsquo; programs in a couple of universities as part of the EU funded Skill Set program; and supported other remote tutors.<br /><br />In 2015 Janice spent six-month in Bangalore, India, working for MPC Advertising as a Compositing Trainer. She returned to Los Angeles afterwards and has been working as a Nuke compositor for MPC LA.<br /><br />
